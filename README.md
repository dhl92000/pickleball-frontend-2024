# Pickleball Skies ‚òÅÔ∏èüèì

Pickleball Skies is a mobile app that helps users check for ideal wind conditions for playing pickleball. Users can see a colourful visual and some details about the weather based on their location, to determine if that day is a good day to play pickleball.

## How It's Made:

Tech used: React Native and Expo.

Expo: Expo is a very helpful set of tools built on top of React Native. It allows easy development of apps for both iOS and Android platforms, regardless of operating system. In the future, I would like to learn bare React Native development, but Expo made it easy to dive into mobile development.

## Lessons Learned
Perhaps it's because I use my phone frequently, but developing mobile apps with React Native and Expo feels very intuitive and fun, while challenging. 

Mobile development is quite different from web development, in that there is no browser, no CSS, no DOM. A mobile interface also involves haptic technology, and so there are still so many lessons to be learned.

I did find that there were also similarities between mobile and web development - Designing the structure of the app is straight-forward, as passing state through props, and the concept of different screens is similar to building different pages and components in browser-based React apps.

## Future Features

Some features I plan on implementing are:

- Users to type in a 'city' input and fetch their location with a geocoding API
- Save favourite locations to fetch weather data on app load
- Searchable pickleball game rules, so users can check rules during games
- Dark mode
